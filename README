DS 1 - Linked List
    learning goal: implement a Linked list and its basic operations in JS from scratch
    
    Learned concepts:
    1. Linked list can be build out of factory functions, Classes or Constructors and they are composed of two of these objects: a Node and the Linked List and an iteration logic

    2. I selected factory functions to build mine and did not based it oupon JS Arrays and array built-in methods, but rather an implementation that mimics the unordered nature of a linked list. 
    Based on my online research, I built my iteration logic as follows: 
     - The first node ever appended becomes the head
     - Each subsequent node is assigned as its predecesor's pointer
     - Upon any appending, searching or removing operations, I assign the head to a temporary pointer (current = head) to start the iteration and use a while/for loop to iterate through each node's next (pointer) until the desired index is reached to perform the relevant action.
