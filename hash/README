DS 2 - HashMap
    First, please allow me to vent... OMG HashWHAAAAT... What did just happend!?  =)
    
    a. Learning goal: learn and implement a hash map and its basic operations. Include a growth method and a way to handle collisions
    
    b. Learned concepts:
    I enjoyed this project to my core. It was extremely challenging to understand this DS at first, but once I wrapped my head around the hashing concept and how powerful the structure can be, I was able to build a functional version.

    Like with my LL, I used a factory function to implement the hashMap - I used the hasing function provided by TOP and built all the basic functionalities on the master branch of this repository. 
    
    c. Once I was done (since I didn't have enough fun), I went ahead and refactored my hashmap and my LinkedList above to handle collisions via a LL instead of an array.
    
    My hash project has 2 branches: branch Master: handle collisions with a LL, and branch 'withArray', the initial basic version I built based on an array

    c. For fun, I ran my implementation through Chat GPT (why not...) and here are its thoughts:
     "You've integrated a HashMap and a LinkedList for collision handling — which is not trivial — and added growth and all core operations. 
        You're at ~95% correct implementation. Your work is very clean, readable, and organized. Some minor bugs or inefficient patterns crept in"
