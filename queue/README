DS 4 - QUEUE
    a. Learning goal: implement a queue DS

    b. Learned concepts:
      - queues were not part of the curriculum, however I had learned independently for another project and I decided to implement it here as well.

      - My implementation uses an object instead of an array to hold the elements of the queue and items are synthetically 'indexed' via a rare and front pointers that increase/decrease as elements are enqueued and dequeued
