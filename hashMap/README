DS 2 - HashMap
    a. Learning goal: learn and implement a hash map and its basic operations. Include a growth method and a way to handle collisions
    
    b. Learned concepts:
    I enjoyed this project to my core. It was extremely challenging to understand this DS at first, but once I wrapped my head around the hashing concept, I was able to see how powerful the structure can be.

    I used a factory function to implement the hashMap, with the hasing function provided by TOP and I built all the basic functionalities on the mmain branch of this repository. Once done with the basic implementation, I went ahead and refactored it to handle collisions via a LinkedList instead of an array.
